To Whom it May Concern,

Hello.  My name is John Fisher.  I have been an annually consistent donor to Ryan's Well Foundation but this year I would like to do more.  I am writing this letter to you in hopes of receiving your unpartnered approval of LetsPlayGlobalGames support for Ryan's Well Fondation, simply as a beneficiary, and to notify you of my efforts which are described below.

I was recently inspired by the online website www.freerice.com and its mission to provide free rice to help end world hunger.  As a software and website developer myself I decided that I could construct a similar website but instead of hunger, focus on the problem of lack in clean water.

Over the past year, as a first step, I've created the basic design of my website, www.letsplayglobalgames.com, an online educational website teaching those who play about flags, countries and capitals of the world.  I would like to donate 80% of the revenue I generate from this website's advertising to Ryan's Well Foundation for at least the first 12 months.  After those first 12 months, I may be reaching out to other non-profit organization with similar global missions.  I've read the Ryan's Well Foundation Fundraising Policy and will gladly agree to all of those points.

However, before any of this exciting process begins, LetsPlayGlobalGames will need to secure a consistent source of revenue.  If you visit the LetsPlayGlobalGames website, you will see areas currently empty that are dedicated to future advertisements.  Over the next few months, it is my goal to fill in these areas with willing advertisers.  Specifically, I would like to target well known companies with a global mission at their core so that users will see these companies contributing to a great cause.  This will, in effect, promote the visibility of these companies while generating the desired revenue feeding LetsPlayGlobalGames.  Companies currently being considered are:
- Rosetta Stone (http://www.rosettastone.com/)
- Jack's Soap (http://jackssoap.com/)
- Vestas Wind Systems (http://www.vestas.com/)
- Indosole (http://www.indosole.com/)

If you have any questions or comments otherwise, please feel free to respond to this notice at letsplayglobalgames@gmail.com  Again, this notice is simply to inform Ryan's Well Foundation of LetsPlayGlobalGames efforts.
I sincerely appreciate your time.


Thanks very much,
LetsPlayGlobalGames
John Fisher

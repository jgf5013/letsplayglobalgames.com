To Whom it May Concern,

Hello.  My name is John Fisher from the online website, www.LetsPlayGlobalGames.com  I am writing to you in hopes of a mutually beneficial partnership with an end goal of helping impoverished third-world regions in need of adequately clean water and resources.  I am constantly amazed at how much work needs to be done improve these harsh conditions around the world.  The good news is that I'm ever-more amazed by organizations like Vestas Wind Systems, who are putting in the effort and making the change.  Over the past year I have been working on an effort of my own, LetsPlayGlobalGames, to improve these conditions.  The partnership I am seeking with Vestas is a simple one:  LetsPlayGlobalGames would like to promote Vestas via advertisements at a competitive rate.  LetsPlayGlobalGames will then be re-contributing 80% of this incoming money to address the issue of lack in clean water in impoverished regions of the world.  For the first 12 months, the Non-profit, Ryan's Well Foundation, will be the sole beneficiary of this revenue stream.  After 12 months, if LetsPlayGlobalGames has secured a steady and reliable source of incoming money, LetsPlayGlobalGames would like to use that money directly to set up clean water wells in these impoverished countries in lieu of requiring third-party involvement.

My idea to use online educational gaming is inspired from the online website www.FreeRice.com and its mission to provide free rice to help end world hunger.  As a software and website developer myself, I decided that I could construct a similar website but instead of hunger, focus on the problem of lack in clean water.

Over the past year, as a first step, I've created the basic design of my website, www.LetsPlayGlobalGames.com, also an online educational website teaching those who play about flags, countries and capitals of the world.  Although the website and game still have and will always have much progress to make, the basic design idea is in place and I would like to start attracting users to the site.  However, encouraging new users to LetsPlayGlobalGames is a bit of a Catch-22:  more users will be drawn to the site if they see that they are contributing to a good cause.  But without a heavy stream of users, LetsPlayGlobalGames realizes that online advertising may not generate much revenue without a caring company to advertise for.  It is the hope of LetsPlayGlobalGames that Vestas Wind Systems is willing to break this cycle while being part of a much needed revenue stream for LetsPlayGlobalGames and while also investing in advertising for Vestas.

So LetsPlayGlobalGames is searching for your support.  If you visit the LetsPlayGlobalGames website, you will see areas dedicated to advertisements but which are currently empty.  Over the next few months, it is my goal to fill in these areas with willing advertisers.  Specifically, I am targeting well known companies with a global mission and reach at their core so that users will see these companies contributing to a great cause.  This will, in effect, promote the visibility of these companies while generating the desired revenue feeding LetsPlayGlobalGames.  Because Vestas Wind Systems so well fits the aforementioned description, I would like to include the organization among other similar ones in our online advertisements.  Other companies currently being considered are:
- Rosetta Stone (http://www.rosettastone.com/)
- Jack's Soap (http://jackssoap.com/)
- Indosole (http://www.indosole.com/)

Obviously, details concerning advertising prices, logos and many other topics will need to be worked out but as a first step, LetsPlayGlobalGames wanted to gauge the interest of Vestas in this mutually beneficially relationship.  Because LetsPlayGlobalGames is not profit-driven I expect to be very flexible concerning any and all details.  Please feel free to respond to this notice at letsplayglobalgames@gmail.com.  I look forward to hearing from you.


I sincerely appreciate your time.
Thanks very much,
LetsPlayGlobalGames
